## Divide and Conquer algorithms 
These are known for their ability to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
### Binary Search Algorithms
  - Searching an item from mid position from an sorted array
### Quicksort Algorithms
  - Sorting an array by selecting first element as pivot and finds lesser array and greater array and attach it.
### Merge Sort
  - It divides the array into two halves, sorts them separately and then merges them.
### Strassen's Algorithm
  - Divides large matrix into smaller ones and perform the necessary operations.
### Karatsuba Algorithm
  - Used for larger number multiplications.
  - Used in cryptography
### Tower of Hanoi
  - It is a mathematical puzzle, an problem of recursion
### Closest Pair of Points
  - This is a problem that arises in computational geometry, and it involves finding the two points in a set of points in the x-y plane that are closest to each other.


### Key advantages 

- Lower time complexity
- Used in computationlly intensive algorithms such as image processing, machine learning, and scientific simulations.
- May not be best choice for memory-constrained environments
- Independent sub problems can run in parallel

## Greedy Algorithms
It focus on making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

```Most optimal or greediest choice at each decision point```

For example, Coin change problem will look at higher denomination first and substract the remaining amount until it turns to zero.

### Huffman coding
- Data compression technique
- Assigns shorter codes for most frequently occurring characters and longer for least

### Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Used in computer networks to optimize network performance
- Finding a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph

### Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Finds the most cost-effective option of the node in the graph

### Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- Finding shortest path between two nodes in a graph

### Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack

## Dynamic Programming algorithms

Dynamic programming is designed to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and storing the results of these sub-problems to avoid redundant computation.

### Top-down (Memoization)

### Bottom-up

## Brute Force Algorithms 
Brute Force are the most straightforward algorithms that work by trying every possible solution and selecting the best one.
